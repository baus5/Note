# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of computer science concerned with programs that learn.



## Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence is also an area of computer science, but it is concerned with developing programs that are intelligent, or can do intelligent things.



## Problem

*Find a model or procedure that makes best use of historical data comprised of inputs and outputs in order to skillfully predict outputs given new and unseen inputs in the future.*



## Solution







## Your First Project Steps

A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.
